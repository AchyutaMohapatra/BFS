You must have already guessed what the article is about from the title. The project that will be discussed in this article is a part of our skill development project - 2 in the 4th semester of our B.Tech journey.
Let us begin with the team members of our project, Our project is led by myself, 20000331382 Achyuta Kumar Mohapatra, and my friend 2000031489 S. Akhil Kumar and 2000031871 Bala Uday Shankar.
Now let us get into the description of our project:
Banks perform various roles in the economy. First, they ameliorate the information problems between investors and borrowers by monitoring the latter and ensuring a proper use of the depositors’ funds. Second, they provide intertemporal smoothing of risk that cannot be diversified at a given point in time, as well as insurance to depositors against unexpected consumption shocks. Because of the maturity mismatch between their assets and liabilities, however, banks are subject to the possibility of runs and systemic risk. Third, banks contribute to the growth of the economy. Fourth, they perform an important role in corporate governance. The relative importance of the different roles of banks varies substantially across countries and times but, banks are always critical to the financial system.
